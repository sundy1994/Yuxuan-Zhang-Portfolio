# [Project 1: Analysis and Modeling of Traffic Accidents in US](https://github.com/sundy1994/Project-US-accidents)

### Overview

* Analyzed 1.5 million accident cases using Python and predicted the severity of accidents based on time, location, weather and traffic condition.
* Visualized the number and severity of accidents cases dynamically on interactive maps with plotly and folium package.
* Utilized unsupervised machine learning such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering to reduce dimension and visualize the accident data.
* Implemented and evaluated machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest model, Naïve Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression and reach a testing accuracy of 89% by stacking several models.

**Key Words:**  Python, Pandas, Data wrangling, EDA, Data visualization, Machine Learning, Classification

# [Project 2: NBA Database Server Website](https://github.com/sundy1994/Project-NBA-Server)

### Overview

* Designed a 4-page interactive website with Node/React JS and HTML to help viewers discover new players, teams as well as matches in NBA.
* Constructed a relational database from several large datasets and operated it in Relational Database Service (RDS) of Amazon Web Service (AWS).
* Programmed complex SQL queries to guarantee users using advanced filtering to search for in-depth information
* Established a team-building function allowing users to build their own NBA team of 5 with total payroll and players’ photos showing on top of it.

**Key Words:**  SQL, JAVA Script, Web Application, Relational Database, AWS, Data Wrangling, Query Optimization

# [Project 3: Classification of X-Ray images using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sundy1994/Project-X-Ray-Image-Classification)

### Overview

 * Implemented the CoAtNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify thousands of Chest X-Ray images from Covid-19, normal and pneumonia patients.
 * Constructed the model based on TensorFlow and sklearn in Google Colab and AWS SageMaker and measured the performance by learning curves, confusion matrix as well as testing error.
 * Improved testing accuracy to 89% and reduced overfitting comparing to the baseline ResNet model.
 
 **Key Words:** TensorFlow, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network, Image Classification, CoAtNet, AWS Sagemaker

# [Project 4: Early social and structural determinants of adolescent wellbeing](https://github.com/sundy1994/Project-Fragile-Family)

### Overview

 * Created a dataset suitable for model-fitting to investigate the relationship between early life factors and adolescent wellbeing
 * Formulated a standard label from published studies to assess adolescent social and psychological wellbeing
 * Implemented and tested a variety of machine learning models in R, such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with LASSO regularization, Random Forest and Baggings
 * Visualized a decision tree from the Random Forest model that displays interpretable relationships between early predictors of child wellbeing 

**Key Words:**  R, dplyr, Data wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning, Random Forest
