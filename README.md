# [Project 1: Analysis and Modeling of Traffic Accidents in US](https://github.com/sundy1994/Project-US-accidents)
* Built and analyzed different models using Python to predict the severity of accidents based on time, location weather and traffic condition from 1.5 million accident cases.
* Utilized machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest model, Na√Øve Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression and evaluated their performances.
* Implemented unsupervised machine learning such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering to visualize the accident data.
* Created interactive plots on US and Philly map with plotly and folium package, which dynamically displayed the number and severity of accidents in each state/road.
